Giving a talk in the technological world as junior software developers seemed a scary task because we might think that we have nothing to say that has not been said before, or that our experience is somehow invalid because we are juniors. However, since we started in this new world, our colleagues have told us repeatedly that **we all have something to tell**, that we had to lose our fear and throw ourselves into participating in a technological event. We did, and not only did we share our knowledge and experiences, but we helped to give visibility to more women and possibly encourage more women to give a talk or become interested in the field. Participating in a technological event and sharing our knowledge and experiences was a goal we wanted to achieve since we began as developers, **AdalaberFest** was our opportunity and we took it. 


[Adalaberfest](https://adalaberfest.adalab.es/) is an event created by and for Adalabers (women who have completed the [Adalab](http://adalab.es/) intensive front-end course), which is open to the whole tech community. The main purpose of the event is to provide Adalabers with a safe space to give their first tech talks, and motivate them to give more talks at other events in the future. The event also aims to show the tech community that Adalabers (and women in general) have a lot to offer and to contribute to diversity within tech conferences. Adalaberfest 2021 included five talks on a variety of subjects, from personal experiences to live coding, and its speakers were supported by mentors who volunteered their free time to help out. 

The technology sector is primarily male-dominated. Although many women have broken barriers and pushed limitations, women still occupy limited spaces in the tech world. According to data from the European Commission, **only 29 women out of every 1,000 graduates graduate in a computer-related career and only 4 start working in technology**. This is alarming as technology is shaping our present and our future. If we don't have enough women contributing to shaping and creating technology, it will respond to the needs of men. For that reason, there needs to be diversity in all aspects. Diversity ensures that technology products are inclusive. 

There are still far more men participating in tech events than women, even though there are more and more women working in tech every year. We want to give visibility to women in the computing industry - to stand up and show everyone that we are here! The more visibility women have in this sector, the more we will challenge gender stereotypes within it. When this happens, not only will people in tech be more open to diversity, people from more diverse backgrounds will want to apply. We want girls to be encouraged to study science and technology if it’s something they’re interested in, and not be discouraged because of gender biases. **The more women give talks, the more it’s normalised within the community and the more we pave the way for future generations of women in technology**.

## About the talks

#### ...but I’m not a software engineer! Or am I?
##### Speaker: Megan Edwards

My talk was called *...but I’m not a software engineer! Or am I?*. I chose this topic because I wanted to talk about how I didn’t feel like an engineer when I first started my job. It was my first job in a new career, after only 3 months of an intensive programming course. Also, my course only covered front-end topics, not all software; I felt like I couldn’t compete with computer science graduates. However, in the last year and a half I’ve learned that although those graduates may have an advantage in terms of technical knowledge, we (Adalabers) more than make up for it with our passion, commitment and ability to learn! I wanted to share my experience and show that it’s not necessary to have a degree in computer science to work as a software engineer. I hoped to encourage more women (or just people in general) to try new things and understand that they bring their own set of skills/experience with them to whatever they do.

#### Event Stormig, collective learning dynamics. What is wanted from the application and what for.
##### Speaker: Libertad Pozos

At Osoco I have had the opportunity to work on different projects, both back and front end, and one of the things I have learned that has nothing to do with code and is fundamental to development is the importance of understanding what is being done and why. As programmers, we are often given specifications with information that is jumbled, incomplete, difficult to understand. That's why I decided to give a talk on Event Storming, a collective learning workshop where we explore the domain and understand the client's business as a consequence and propose appropriate solutions. I also shared my experience doing Event Storming and how this tool makes our work easier, because software development is much less complicated if you understand the problem domain.
